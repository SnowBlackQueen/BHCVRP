# Biblioteca de Heurísticas de Construcción para Problemas de Planificación de Rutas de Vehículos (BHCVRP)
BHCVRP allows the reuse of different construction heuristics in different Vehicle Routing Problems. In addition, it is in the process of being robustly designed to allow flexible incorporation of new heuristics and VRP´s variants, as well as their deployment as part of more complex solutions. Currently, the library contains seven construction heuristics:
🔹 Christofides, Mingozzi and Toth (CMT) Parallel Insertion.
🔹 Mole & Jameson Sequential Insertion. 
🔹 Nearest neighbor with restricted candidate list. 
🔹 Random method. 
🔹 Sweep algorithm. 
🔹 Savings algorithm with its versions: sequential and parallel.

Finally, it solves four variants of VRP:
🔸 Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
🔸 Multi Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP).
🔸 Truck and Trailer Routing Problem (TTRP).
🔸 Heterogenous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (HFVRP).
